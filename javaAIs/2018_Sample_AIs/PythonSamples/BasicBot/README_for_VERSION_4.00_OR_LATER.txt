In FightingICE 4.00, we have changed the 'Python' directory's path.

Copy all files with the extension .py to the python directory in FTG4.00 
and copy the file BasicBot.pkl to FTG4.00/data/aiData/BasicBot/

Launch FigthingICE with the following arguments:
--py4j -grey-bg --port 6500

Then at the python directory in FTG4.00, 
python Main_PyAIvsPyAI_BasicBotvsDisplayInfo_6500.py
for a game of BasicBot vs DisplayInfo.

That's all folks!
